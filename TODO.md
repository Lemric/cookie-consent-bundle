# Next!
- Cookie settings
  - [ ] Allow only necessary cookies
  - [x] Add domain as configurable option
  - form action:
    - **why is cookie consent modal shown again after redirect to route?**
    - [x] prevent default form submit
- Logic
  - [x] Set Cookie after rejecting all cookies to not display the dialog again
  - [ ] ID for cookie consent log as UUID instead of integer
- JavaScript
  - [x] update JS to .mjs and add bundler like rollup
  - [x] emit successful submit form event
  - [x] submit form asynchronously
- SCSS
  - [x] no need for seperate styling scss
  - [ ] Style dialog
- Markup
  - [x] make form available in dialog (Fuck off, IE11!!!)
- Forms
  - [x] Style form --> form styles can be applied by using and configuring the symfony twig bundle
      - https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/form_themes.html
      - https://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html#rendering-forms
  - [ ] What parts are themeable and changeable?
    - [ ] Header 
      - has to be generic to place logo, title or whatever
    - [ ] Main section
      - [ ] pre-form section
      - [ ] Form
        - [ ] form widgets
          - overwritable [CookieConsentType.php](Form%2FCookieConsentType.php)???
        - [ ] form submit buttons
      - [ ] post-form section
    - [ ] Footer
      - has to be generic to whatever content to user needs
- Security
  - Which domain is set when setting cookies? With subdomain?
- Project setup
  - [ ] Create Symfony Flex recipe: https://github.com/symfony/recipes
  - [ ] Setup watchers for JS and SCSS separately
    - Separate dev from prod builds 
    - JS is handled by Rollup watching assets and rebuilding if needed, notifying the websocket server when done
    - SCSS is handled like before but with a watcher, maybe use https://github.com/egoist/rollup-plugin-postcss - so we can build in rollup only
